<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>After a few days of procrastinating because I was (and still am) really nervous about this job application, I&#39;m finally writing this post on the deadline!</p>
<h2>A bit about me</h2>
<p>My name is Paul Amoah and I&#39;m the fastest ma- sorry wrong intro... I&#39;m a Software Engineer (mostly YouTube certified) and Electrical Engineer (got my degree last year!).
I&#39;m 22 at the time of writing this with my birthday coming up in about 8 days. I&#39;m also Christian.</p>
<p>I started coding about 5 years ago in 2019 before my first year of university. I started with some basic HTML and CSS tutorials on W3Schools. Eventually, I moved to
Khan Academy to learn JavaScript by drawing graphics on the screen using a library called ProcessingJS. I really enjoyed it but the fun ended
when I began my first semester of the university with no laptop for school. I was lucky enough to have a great friend who lent me his laptop from time to time to code in
the second semester though. Then covid happened! For about 9 months, all I did everyday was watch tutorials and code. Everything from Computer Networking and
Ethical Hacking all the way to Machine Learning and Web Development. As you can probably already tell by this point, I fell in love with Web Development the most and
decided to stick with it. Since then I&#39;ve built quite a few projects, some of which you can check out <a href="/pages/projects/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Current work and time zone</h2>
<p>I currently work as a Teaching Assistant in Ghana at my undergraduate university (Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology). I&#39;m doing this as required service
to my nation. Contrary to what you may be thinking, my current work status and time zone will not in any way be a hindrance. As a TA, my work schedule is quite flexible. I only work for about 6 to 10 hours a week, alternating between class and other duties (eg. evaluating exam scripts). The rest of my time is spent on personal projects
and a few other side gigs I work to make some extra bucks. If I get this job, I&#39;ll gladly drop the other side gigs (without much
consequence) and focus that energy into making sure you never regret your decision.</p>
<p>As for the time zone difference, it&#39;s not that bad. Not at all. At the moment, Robin and I are only two hours apart and I&#39;m willing to work extra hours to ensure full
overlap if required. I code most of the time anyway so I believe it&#39;s gonna go great!</p>
<h2>Okay, so why me?</h2>
<p>Seems like you&#39;ve already laid out the ground work for answering this question in your well-thought-out and beautifully-crafted job posting so I&#39;m just gonna use that.</p>
<h3>Who I am</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>I like to pair on problems.</strong> I love to exchange ideas and talk things through with teammates to get a better sense of the problem space. I also just like to laugh
around and be a little silly during pairing sessions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I hold people to a high standard, and inspire them to do their best work.</strong> I really value giving candid feedback to guide and motivate my teammates in the right
direction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I&#39;m fanatical about polish.</strong> This is a big one. I&#39;d even go to the extent of saying I&#39;m a bit obsessive about making sure everything is almost perfect, down to the
last full stop because I believe a polished codebase is a welcoming codebase, either to other developers or future me, both of which are likely to spend more time with
the project than my present self.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I miss when software used to be fast.</strong> I love optimizing the hell out of my code, mostly because I usually write performance critical software. That being said, I
wait and observe before I jump into things, avoiding hasty optimizations that may have a net negative impact in the long run.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I&#39;m energized by unfamiliar territory.</strong> This is definitely true. To be honest, I&#39;m not too familiar with Rust, but I&#39;m particularly excited about learning Rust and
exploring the Rust parts of the codebase.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I&#39;m a great writer.</strong> I put in quite a bit of effort into communicating clearly. I believe my experience in teaching is also a great contributing factor to
this. <a href="https://promethium.js.org/">Here</a>&#39;s an example of some documentation I&#39;ve prepared in the past.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I&#39;m good at breaking down projects.</strong> During my final year project in the university, I was helping out about 6 other friends with their projects. Even though
this took a bit of a toll of my project timeline, I was able efficiently break down the project and get a working demo by presentation time. I was even able to hack
together a collaboration engine between the hours of 12am and 3am. The presentation was due around 8am! It was a solid presentation by God&#39;s Grace.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I&#39;m love great design.</strong> I&#39;m not much of a design person, but I do appreciate great design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>On the technology side</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Node.js</strong> - I&#39;ve literally spent more time in Node than any other programming environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>TypeScript</strong> - I love TypeScript, period! Honestly one of the best type systems out there despite what other people say and I can&#39;t help but feel like there&#39;s
something missing nowadays when I code in raw JavaScript.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>React</strong> - Are you kidding me? <a href="/pages/projects/promethium-js">PromethiumJS</a> was once a clone of React. They&#39;re still quite similar but Promethium is more like SolidJS
now with the use of &quot;signals&quot; and such.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility</strong> - To be honest, I&#39;ve always let the platform and the component libraries I use handle this for me but I can&#39;t wait to be on the other side and tackle
accessibility issues so that others don&#39;t have to.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rust</strong> - I mentioned previously that I&#39;m not too familiar with Rust, but I&#39;m definitely excited to work with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> - I mean...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upcoming projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop a Tailwind CSS bundler plugin for Next.js.</strong> Working with Vercel to make Tailwind work better Next? Of course yes!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Create a JavaScript library for running Tailwind CSS v4.0 in the browser</strong> - These are the kinds of things I like to do for fun. To do this for my job would be an
absolute dream!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Design a set of IDE integration APIs for Tailwind CSS</strong> - Bring it on! I&#39;m all for optimizing code editing experiences. I&#39;m a Neovim user after all.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Design, build, and document a Tooltip component for Headless UI</strong> - I&#39;m excited to research on the best ways this has been done in the past and come up with an
excellent API that conforms with the rest of the Headless UI components.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Build a backwards compatibility layer for Tailwind CSS v4.0</strong> - A very necessary undertaking that I would be honoured to be part of.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Campaign for simplified Tailwind CSS integration in popular frameworks and bundlers</strong> - This definitely sounds like something I would be delighted to do. Carefully
thinking through implementation details and the back and forth with various talented individuals from the community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Closing note</h1>
<p>Ultimately, I just love building cool things and it makes me really happy to be able to contribute to projects that many people depend on. An open source contribution I&#39;m
particularly proud of is <a href="https://github.com/runem/lit-analyzer/pull/327">this one</a>. This is for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was able to jump into a fairly new project I was unfamiliar with and learn just the parts that I needed to learn to solve the problem at hand.</li>
<li>I worked closely with an engineer from Google that was actively working on an open source project that I use quite regularly. It was quite exciting for me.</li>
<li>It was different from all my other projects because many people really depend on this project.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really do hope and pray that I get this job. If I do, I look forward to experimenting with things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Web Components for Headless UI (to target all other
frameworks at once)</li>
<li>Trying out Go for performance critical parts of the libraries</li>
<li>Building a Tailwind debugger UI</li>
<li>Implementing support for truly dynamic tailwind classes</li>
</ul>
<p>That is of course if any of these are of interest to you. In any case, if I don&#39;t, I wish you guys all the very best. Keep at it with the great work you&#39;re doing.</p>
<p>God bless y&#39;all and until next time...hopefully!</p>
