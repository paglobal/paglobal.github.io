<p>It&#39;s Christmas! It&#39;s also 3am and I&#39;m here watching videos about advice from people like Donald Knuth, Bjarne Stroustrup and Richard Hamming. There&#39;s something peaceful about this time of the day or night, or whatever you like to call it. I&#39;ve got a Gospel song on repeat, Nkwagye Kuwura, a rendition by Joe Mettle and Love Gift, feeling extremely grateful for how far the Good Lord has brought me. Alright, on to research!</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I want to have a great impact on this world, and I believe that God has equipped me best for that through the way I think. I&#39;m by no means trying to say I&#39;m some sort of &quot;boy genius&quot; or anything like that, but I believe God has given me something special; God has given every one of us something special. Of course that sounds so clich√©, especially if you have nothing much to show for it. One of the greatest shames, I think, is wasted potential. Sitting on something God has given you and not making any good use of it until you depart from this world.</p>
<p>Now when I say positive impact, I mean that in relation to both our lives on earth and afterwards, because I believe that we&#39;re transcendental beings, and this is just one phase of our existence, where there&#39;s little as important as discovering the purpose the Creator has predestined for you.</p>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Sorry to end the previous section so abruptly, but it&#39;s now 4am, and I&#39;m looking through forums and videos about P and NP problems. But this section is titled &quot;What?&quot;. So what&#39;s my current field of interest? What do I want to reearch on? Well, it&#39;s kinda complicated, or not. I&#39;ve chosen Computer Architecture, but I haven&#39;t really strongly considered any sub-fields as at the time of writing this post, which seems at the very least crucial in getting admitted to pursue a PhD. What I have at the moment, is a problem I want to solve. Are they mutually exclusive? It depends, maybe. What&#39;s this problem, you ask? Unity, standardization and coherence.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s 9am, took a little nap. So my experience with the world of Computer Architecture hasn&#39;t been nearly as smooth as my experience with the Software Engineering world. In Software Engineering, things are more open, and there a more communities where people collaborate more to solve problems. Naturally, there are also more standards when it comes to things like testing and benchmarking. This makes th</p>
