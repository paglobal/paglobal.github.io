# Promethium JS

I've learnt quite a lot from this project. At first I was hesitant about building web apps with large frameworks, then I was curious about the inner workings of those frameworks. Eventually, I ended up building one of my own. It's been quite fun an rewarding, and I personally use this framework and actually quite enjoy it a lot so I'd say it hasn't been a complete waste of time.
