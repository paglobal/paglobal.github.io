# Augmented Tabflow

This is an extension I built to increase my productivity in Chrome. I put it on the Chrome Web Store just in case others also find it useful. If you do find it useful, want to show some appreciation, and can afford to, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/paglobal). Regardless, the extension will remain free for everyone forever. Go forth and be productive!
