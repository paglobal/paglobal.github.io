# Augmented Tabflow

A chrome extension I'm working on to increase my productivity with tab groups using tab group sessions (made that up). Also, I just wanted to build a chrome extension (happens way more than you would think). Anyways, I'm gonna finish it and upload it to the chrome web store pretty soon.
