# Augmented Tabflow

This is an extension I built to increase my productivity in Chrome. I put it on the Chrome Web Store just in case others also find it useful. Consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/paglobal) if you find this extension useful, want to show some appreciation and can afford to. Regardless, the extension will remain free for everyone forever. Go forth and be productive!
