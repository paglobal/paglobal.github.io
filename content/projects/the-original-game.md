# The Original Game

Just a silly game I created out of boredom during the pandemic. It goes beyond that though, given that this was the first time I felt like I really started to grasp programming fundamentals. It haven't worked on it in a while though, and in it's current state, it's not optimized for mobile phones and other small screens. I've also been told that the controls take a bit of getting used to. I keep it around to remind me how I started. And it honestly still surprises me sometimes that three years ago, I was able to build something like this. I also sometimes play it when I remember it exists.
