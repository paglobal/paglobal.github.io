# The Original Game

Just a silly game I created out of boredom during covid. Really helped me grasp programming fundamentals though. I haven't worked on it in a while and in it's current state, it's not optimized for mobile phones and other small screens. I've also been told that the controls take a bit of getting used to. I keep it around to remind me how I started. I still play it sometimes when I remember it exists.
