# 2BKMPE2R

Whoa, that's a mouthful!

This project was born from [this research project](/pages/research/2bkmpe2r.html). It's basically an [Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) based on the [MIPS architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture), and a corresponding microarchitecture implementation. It also includes an assembler that compiles 2bkmpe2r assembly to [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)-compatible hex code, and simulation files for simulating the microarchitecture in Logisim, alongside detailed diagrams of the microarchitecture implementation.
