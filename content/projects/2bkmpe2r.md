# 2BKMPE2R

It's an [Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) based on the [MIPS architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture), and a corresponding microarchitecture implementation. The project includes simulation files for simulating the microarchitecture in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), and an assembler that compiles 2bkmpe2r assembly to Logisim-compatible hex code. Also present are detailed diagrams of the microarchitecture implementation.
