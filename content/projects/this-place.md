# This Place

I built this place as my home on the internet where people can come visit. It was supposed to be a simple site made with plan ol' HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I ended up building a mini Static Site Generator to make it easier and more ergonomic to put content on here. The style is adapted from [Astro Cactus Theme](https://astro-theme-cactus.netlify.app/) as stated in the footer of this site. Feel free to copy the code and modify it to suite your needs. I'm looking forward to making some improvements in the near future to make it easier to customize and work with.
