# The Gatekeeper

The Gatekeeper is a project whose direction I'm currently uncertain of, aside from the fact that it will probably be used to teach the Digital Systems course back at school. Currently, it's a very simple Computer Architecture simulator, kind of like [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) but with the added twist of collaborative editing, great for educational settings.
