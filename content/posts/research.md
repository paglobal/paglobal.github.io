# Research

<p class="article-date">Dec 25, 2023</p>

It's Christmas! It's also 3am and I'm here watching videos about advice from people like Donald Knuth, Bjarne Stroustrup and Richard Hamming. There's something peaceful about this time of the day or night, or whatever you like to call it. I've got a Gospel song on repeat, Nkwagye Kuwura, a rendition by Joe Mettle and Love Gift, feeling extremely grateful for how far the Good Lord has brought me. Alright, on to research!

## Why?

I want to have a great impact on this world, and I believe that God has equipped me best for that through the way I think. I'm by no means trying to say I'm some sort of "boy genius" or anything like that, but I believe God has given me something special; God has given every one of us something special. Of course that sounds so clich√©, especially if you have nothing much to show for it. One of the greatest shames, I think, is wasted potential. Sitting on something God has given you and not making any good use of it until you depart from this world.

Now when I say positive impact, I mean that in relation to both our lives on earth and afterwards, because I believe that we're transcendental beings, and this is just one phase of our existence, where there's little as important as discovering the purpose the Creator has predestined for you.

## What?

Sorry to end the previous section so abruptly, but it's now 4am, and I'm looking through forums and videos about P and NP problems. But this section is titled "What?". So what's my current field of interest? What do I want to reearch on? Well, it's kinda complicated, or not. I've chosen Computer Architecture, but I haven't really strongly considered any sub-fields as at the time of writing this post, which seems at the very least crucial in getting admitted to pursue a PhD. What I have at the moment, is a problem I want to solve. Are they mutually exclusive? It depends, maybe. What's this problem, you ask? Unity, standardization and coherence.

Now it's 9am, took a little nap. So my experience with the world of Computer Architecture hasn't been nearly as smooth as my experience with the Software Engineering world. In Software Engineering, things are more open, and there a more communities where people collaborate more to solve problems. Naturally, there are also more standards when it comes to things like testing and benchmarking. This makes th
